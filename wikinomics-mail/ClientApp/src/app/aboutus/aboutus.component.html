            <p>
              KnowONE is a career platform that empowers you, by connecting you to people who are 
              relevant for you and your career growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through anonymity, we lower the threshold to ask those burning career oriented questions 
              you may have, but are too afraid to ask.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our mission is to ensure that no talent is wasted due to lack of a relevant network.

            <label>Why KnowONE Matters</label>
            <p>
              It's a well known fact that the size of your network allows you access to opportunities 
              you might not have known about otherwise. But, if there's an upside to being well-connected, 
              we believe the opposite to be true for those with a small network. In other words, the playing 
              field is not level.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through our platform, we hope you are reminded of how valuable your knowledge and network 
              is. And, once you realise this, we hope you leverage this to help others.
            </p>

            <p>
              KnowONE matters, because <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone</span> matters.

            <label>The Power of KnowONE</label>
            <p>
              We believe that everyone has a superpower. And, that superpower is about connecting people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although you may feel young and inexperienced, and perhaps even feel like you're "no one", 
              we're convinced that you know ONE person in your network, that can be of help to someone else. 
              And, your SUPERPOWER is to introduce that <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> person 
              to someone else, who you think may benefit from being connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't believe us?
            </p>
            <p>
              Researchers at Microsoft studied records of 30 billion electronic conversations among 180 million 
              people in various countries, and worked out that any two strangers are, on average, distanced by 
              precisely 6.6 degrees of separation. In other words, you are linked by a string of seven or fewer 
              accquintances to Bill Gates, the Dalai Lama and the Queen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine the endless potential for personal and professional growth, if only we shared our experience 
              and knowledge with people <span style="font-style: italic">outside</span> of our own network- the 
              people we call strangers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you connect people, your knowledge and network is amplified. And that, my friend, is the 
              power of KnowONE.
            </p>
            <p>
              KnowONE is more than a career platform; it's a movement.
