            <p>
              KnowONE is a career platform that empowers you, by connecting you to people who are 
              relevant for you and your career growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through anonymity, we lower the threshold to ask those burning career oriented questions 
              you may have, but are too afraid to ask.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our mission is to ensure that no talent is wasted due to lack of a relevant network.

            <label>Why KnowONE Matters</label>
            <p>
              "To the world, you may be one person. But, to one person, you may be the world." <br />
              (Dr. Seuss)
            </p>

            <p>
              Through our platform, we hope you are reminded of how valuable your knowledge and network 
              is. And, once you realise this, we hope you leverage this to help others. <br />
              KnowONE matters, because <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone</span> matters.

            <label>The Power of KnowONE</label>
            <p>
              We believe that everyone has a superpower. And, that superpower is about connecting people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although you may feel young and inexperienced, and perhaps even feel like you're "no one", 
              we're convinced that you know ONE person in your network, that can be of help to someone else. 
              And, your SUPERPOWER is to introduce that <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> person 
              to someone else, who you think may benefit from being connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you connect people, your knowledge and network is amplified. And that, my friend, is the 
              power of KnowONE.
            </p>
            <p>
              KnowONE is more than a career platform; it's a movement.
