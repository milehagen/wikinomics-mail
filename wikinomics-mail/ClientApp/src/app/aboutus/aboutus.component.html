              <h2>Words From The Founder, Mi Le Hagen</h2>
              <p><b>Why "KnowONE"?</b></p>
              <p>
                After 10 years of work experience, I've come across many people with super interesting jobs. 
                And, I've often thought "man, I wish I knew about that profession when I was about to choose 
                my field of study".
              </p>
  
              <p>
                On behalf of my younger self, I wish that I could reach out to anyone  who had an interesting 
                title, or a job that seemed cool, and ask them: "What did you study? What do you earn? What's 
                the best part about your job? What's the worst part about your job?".
              </p>
  
              <p>
                So, I went on a mission to find out how people made their decisions regarding their field of 
                study, or choice of profession. And, after conversations with countless of people, it hit me that 
                the same sentence was repeated over and over: 
              </p>

              <p>
                " I wanted to study engineering. But, I <b>didn't know anyone</b> who is an engineer." <br />
                "I became a doctor, because <b>I knew many people</b> who were doctors..."
              </p>

              <p>
                I realised that; for most of us, our career paths have been highly influenced by people around 
                us- the people within our network. This means that, our source of reference - or, source of 
                information, if you will- is limited by the size of our network.
              </p>

              <p>
                You're probably thinking: "What about Google?" And, sure, we can Google our way through many 
                of our questions. But, it's not the same as getting answers from real people- people who have 
                experience about
              </p>

              <p>
                This is the pain-point I discovered.  And, this is how the idea of "KnowONE" came about.
              </p>

              <p>
                Get to <b>know ONE</b> person. And, benefit from the <b>Know</b>ledge, network, and experience of 
                <b>ONE</b>. Because, sometimes that's all it takes.

              <h2>What Makes KnowONE Different?</h2>
              <p>
                We understand that all people wired differently. So, while some people don't mind reaching 
                out to strangers to ask for information, others find this to be extremely uncomfortable.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                In today's society, we seem to be catering only to those who are extroverted; those who love 
                to mingle, and make new connections.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                At KnowONE we are passionate about making sure that no talent, or potential is wasted, simply 
                because they are too shy, or introverted. So, to remove the fear of reaching out to strangers, 
                we've made sure that you can be anonymous. Because, fear of judgment should not stand in the way 
                of getting the information you need to develop yourself, and your career.
